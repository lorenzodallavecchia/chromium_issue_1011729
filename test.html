<h1>Issue 1011729</h1>
<h2>Source map URLs are not normalized to remove '.' and '..' directories</h2> 

<p>
Open the DevTools console (F12).
You will see three stack traces.

<ol>

    <li>The first stack trace is a direct printout of the <tt>Error.stack</tt> property.
    Hyperlinks are clickable and open the correct source-mapped file</li>

    <li>The second stack trace is obtained by printing the first two lines of the fixed string that 
    <tt>Error.stack</tt> would produce. The string is "magically" recognized and the URLs are linked and work correctly.</li>

    <li>The third stack trace is identical to the second, except for the fact that redundant dots in the URLs
    are removed. The URLs are still hyper-linked, but they <b>no longer open the correct file</b>. Also, they URLs are not
    shortened to just the file name, because the entire string is no longer "magically" recognized as a valid stack trace.</li>

</ol>
